# 📦 Shadcn/UI – Modern UI Components for React

Shadcn/UI is a customizable component library built with Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It's not a traditional npm package – instead, you copy components into your codebase, giving you full control and flexibility.

## 📦 Add Components

To add a component, run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

This command will:
- Fetch the component from shadcn/ui
- Copy it into your project under `components/ui/button.tsx`
- Add all required dependencies (Radix, etc.)

## 🛠 Customize Components

All components are copied into your repo, so you can freely modify styles, logic, or animations.
Example: change button style in `components/ui/button.tsx`:

```tsx
<button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```
