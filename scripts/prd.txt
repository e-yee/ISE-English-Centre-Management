# React App Routing Testing - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Implement comprehensive testing for the ISE English Centre Management React application's routing system using React Testing Library and Jest. The application has complex role-based authentication, protected routes, and multiple user flows that need thorough testing.

## Current System Architecture
- React 19 with TypeScript
- React Router DOM v7.6.3 for routing
- Role-based authentication (teacher, manager, learning adviser)
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- Authentication context with state management
- Multiple auth flows (login, forgot password, token refresh)

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Testing Infrastructure Setup
- Install and configure React Testing Library
- Install and configure Jest DOM for enhanced assertions
- Install and configure MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Set up testing utilities and custom render functions
- Configure test environment for React Router testing

### 2. Authentication & Route Protection Testing
- Test unauthenticated user redirects to login
- Test authenticated user access to protected routes
- Test role-based access control (teacher, manager, learning adviser)
- Test unauthorized access redirects to unauthorized page
- Test loading states during authentication checks
- Test token refresh scenarios
- Test logout functionality and redirects

### 3. Navigation & Routing Testing
- Test successful navigation between routes
- Test route parameter handling
- Test nested route rendering
- Test index route redirects
- Test 404 handling for invalid routes
- Test browser back/forward navigation
- Test programmatic navigation

### 4. Authentication Context Integration Testing
- Test AuthContext provider integration with routes
- Test authentication state persistence
- Test login flow with successful authentication
- Test login flow with failed authentication
- Test forgot password flow (email, verify, reset)
- Test token expiration handling
- Test concurrent authentication requests

### 5. User Journey Testing
- Test complete teacher user journey (login → home → attendance)
- Test complete manager user journey (login → colleagues)
- Test complete learning adviser journey (login → timekeeping/checkin)
- Test authentication flow with role switching
- Test session timeout scenarios
- Test multi-tab authentication scenarios

### 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Test network error handling during authentication
- Test invalid token scenarios
- Test malformed route parameters
- Test deep linking to protected routes
- Test authentication race conditions
- Test browser refresh during authentication
- Test concurrent route access attempts

### 7. API Mocking & Integration Testing
- Mock authentication API endpoints
- Mock user data API endpoints
- Test API error responses
- Test API timeout scenarios
- Test API retry mechanisms
- Test offline scenario handling

### 8. Performance & Accessibility Testing
- Test route transition performance
- Test authentication check performance
- Test accessibility of loading states
- Test keyboard navigation through routes
- Test screen reader compatibility
- Test focus management during route changes

## Technical Requirements

### Testing Libraries
- @testing-library/react (latest version)
- @testing-library/jest-dom (latest version)
- @testing-library/user-event (latest version)
- msw (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- jest (for test runner)
- @types/jest (for TypeScript support)

### Testing Patterns
- Use React Testing Library's guiding principles
- Test user behavior, not implementation details
- Use semantic queries (getByRole, getByLabelText, etc.)
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Use custom render functions for complex providers
- Implement proper cleanup between tests

### Test Organization
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for route combinations
- End-to-end tests for complete user journeys
- Mock tests for API interactions
- Accessibility tests for route components

## Success Criteria
- 90%+ test coverage for routing logic
- All authentication flows tested
- All role-based access scenarios covered
- All error scenarios handled
- Tests run in under 30 seconds
- No false positives in test suite
- Tests are maintainable and readable

## Deliverables
- Complete test suite for routing functionality
- Custom testing utilities and helpers
- Mock service worker setup
- Test documentation and examples
- CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Performance benchmarks for route transitions

## Timeline
- Week 1: Infrastructure setup and basic route testing
- Week 2: Authentication and protection testing
- Week 3: User journey and integration testing
- Week 4: Error handling and edge case testing
- Week 5: Performance testing and optimization
- Week 6: Documentation and final review
